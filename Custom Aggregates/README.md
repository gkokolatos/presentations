# Custom Aggregates

A presentation on creating custom aggregate functions in postgres.

Aggregates are very useful in many scenarios and postgres provides a wealth of
defaults. Readily available extentions cover much more cases.

However, writing a custom aggregate may be the only available way in some
scenarios. Additionally, it provides an excellent window on understanding the
mechanics of Postgres and it's extension mechanism.

The presentation is targeting Postgres v13.
